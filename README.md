# LEG

Intended to mimic the notorious ARMSim#, our language, LEG, is a blend of assembly and JavaScript code for a fun time with assembly. Whether you know Assembly or JavaScript, you are guaranteed to enjoy working with it. Assembly can be tedious and frustrating, for those reasons we bring to you a new and improved assembly-esque language, taking the best of both worlds. Assembly language is for the purpose of creating human-readable code that is as close as possible to machine language. LEG will be similar in that sense because it is a higher level  language intended to be close to assembly. Now break a LEG!
